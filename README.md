# Spooks Game!

Welcome to Spooks where you are a friendly yet angry ghost, the only ghost who can't pass through walls and objects. So, in this game, you gotta avoid hitting the spikes that are coming at you!

I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript to develop this game on Visual Studio Code.

## Instructions:
- Press enter to start and re-start the game.
- Keep pressing the spacebar to jump up to dodge the spikes.

Here's the link to the browser game: https://amirzarie.github.io/Spooks/
Note: This is best enjoyed on a Chrome browser on a large screen.

## Future Items:
* I would modify the game so it renders just as well on a mobile device (screens of any size)
* I would have the game objects randomly change each round of the game (i.e., background image, background music, etc.)
* Keep track of the highest score.
